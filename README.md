**Learning with Texts** (LWT) is a tool for language learning by reading. It is a self-hosted web application.

You feel that you won't learn much by translating dumb sentences or using grammar books? Learning with Texts offers you the possibility to learn by reading texts in your objective language. The idea: when you don't know a word in a text, just click it. We show you the translation, and you will have regular tests to remember it. Ready to go?

**THIS IS A THIRD PARTY VERSION**. This version is not the 
official one, and brings many improvements and new featuress. 
It is quicker, has smaller databse size, 
and is open for contributions. The official version is on 
[source forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learning-with-texts)


## Installation
As it is self-hosted, you will need a server, which can be your computer. 

* Get the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases).
  * You can also try to download the [latest stable version](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) if you want the cutting-edge updates (that may include some bugs).
* **Please see**: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) for detailed instructions.
* Create ``connect.inc.php`` with an existing database user. Everything is explained at [docs/info.html](https://hugofara.github.io/lwt/docs/info.html#install).

And you are ready to go!

Please note that a composer repo is available, as well as an installation using Docker.

## Description
LWT is a language learning web application. To learn a language, you 
need to practice, and we guide you in reading exercices.

First copy/paste any text you want to read. It can be raw text or an RSS feed.

Then, we parse the text. Unkown words will be displayed with different colors,
just click them to see it in a dictionary.

Read as much as you want! 

To make sure you memorize new words, you can take review exercises.

The difference with popular remembering software like 
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is that we keep track of the 
context to help you. By the way, we also ship 
an Anki exporter.
