# About LWT Export Templates for "Flexible Exports"

An export template consists of a string of characters. Some parts of this string are **placeholders** (beginning with **"%", "$" or "\\"**) that are **replaced** by the actual term data, **see the following table**. For each term (word or expression), that has been selected for export, the placeholders of the export template will be replaced by the term data and the string will be written to the export file.

**A template must end with** either **"\\n"** (UNIX, Mac) or **"\\r\\n"** (Windows). **If you omit this, the whole export will be one single line!**

If the export template is **empty, no terms of this language** will be exported.
