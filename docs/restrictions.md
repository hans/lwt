Texts and vocabulary terms with Unicode characters outside the [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) (BMP; U+0000 to U+FFFF), i.e. with Unicode characters U+10000 and higher, are not supported. Therefore, characters for almost all modern languages, and a large number of symbols, are supported; but historic scripts, certain symbols and notations, and Emojis are not supported.
