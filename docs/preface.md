# Preface

*   **THIS IS A THIRD PARTY VERSION** - IT DIFFERS IN MANY RESPECTS FROM THE OFFICIAL LWT-VERSION (see the [new features](#newfeatures))

## Preface by [lang-learn-guy](https://sourceforge.net/u/lang-learn-guy/) (original author)
*   I started this software application in 2010 as a hobby project for my personal learning (reading & listening to foreign texts, saving & reviewing new words and expressions).
*   In June 2011, I decided to publish the software in the hope that it will be useful to other language learners around the world.
*   The software is 100 % free, open source, and in the public domain. You may do with it what you like: use it, improve it, change it, publish an improved version, even use it within a commercial product.
*   English is not my mother tongue - so please forgive me any mistakes.
*   A piece of software will be never completely free of "bugs" - please inform me of any problem you will encounter. Your feedback and ideas are always welcome.
*   My programming style is quite chaotic, and my software is mostly undocumented. This will annoy people with much better programming habits than mine, but please bear in mind that LWT is a one-man hobby project and completely free.
*   Thank you for your attention. I hope you will enjoy this application as I do every day.

I started using LWT in 2021, and continued its development almost instantly. I felt that the core idea was very good, but its implementation seemed unnadapted, and the code was quite obfuscated. While I do not have any official responsibility to LWT (I don't know lang-learn-guy), I am the the *de facto* maintainer of the community version. I dedicated myself to the following points (see the [GitHub post](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/discussions/6)):
* Make LWT Open Source: document and refactor code
* Meet the HTML5 standards: the interface was relying on deprecated systmes like frames, making it difficult to use on small screens.

If you spot any problem, please post any [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues), and we will look at it.

While work is not yet finished, I also aim to expand LWT:
* Better UI: custom themes and better default appearance
* Better UX: as of today (2022), 60 % of the web is done through mobile devices. It means less content at once and more intuitive behaviors.
* Sounds: language learning is not just language reading.
   * Motivational sounds to keep users motivated.
   * Text-to-speech features.

But there is much more! The community version of LWT is no longer feat of one man, it belongs to everyone. As such, it gets well easier to implement new features, discuss and exchange code and ideas. I don't know if LWT contains *your* killer feature, but I can say that it *can be implemented* with this version. Enjoy!
