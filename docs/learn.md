## How to Learn

*   Find an interesting text (preferably with an mp3 audio file) in the Internet and load it into LWT. If you are a beginner, look for beginner courses or podcasts in the Internet.
*   You don't know where to find texts with audio? The [LingQ Library](http://lingq.com) has many (only a free registration is needed). Or look into [this thread](https://www.lingq.com/en/forum/updates-tips-and-known-issues/where-to-find-good-content-to-import/) in the LingQ Forum, you will find there lots of great links to resources. Or click (within the LingQ library) on "My Imports" - you will find a list of links of "Suggested resources".
*   Read the text, look up the new words and expressions (=terms) and save them for review and test.
*   The good thing with LWT: Every saved term will show up with its translation, status, etc. in all other occurrences of the same text and every other text! So you'll see immediately what you already know and how well you know it. And of course you'll see what you don't know!
*   Load the MP3 file also on your portable MP3 player and listen to it often.
*   Review (by reading again) or test your saved words and expressions.

*   That's it. It's that simple.
