## Features

*   You define languages you want to learn.
*   You define the web dictionaries you want to use.
*   You define how sentences and words in the language will be split up.
*   You upload texts, and they are automatically split into sentences and words! Later re-parsing is possible.
*   Optional: Assign the URL of an mp3 audio file of the text (Dropbox, local server, ...) in order to listen while reading the text.
*   You read the text while listening to the audio, and you see immediately the status of every word (unknown, learning, learned, well-known, ignored).
*   You click on words, and you use the external dictionaries to find out their meanings.
*   You save words or expressions (2..9 words) with optional romanization (for asiatic languages), translations and example sentence, you change its status, you edit them whenever needed (like in LingQ).
*   You test your understanding of words and expressions within or without sentence context.
*   MCD (Massive-Context Cloze Deletion) testing, as proposed by Khatzumoto @ AJATT, built-in!
*   See your progress on the statistics page.
*   You may export the words and expressions and use them in Anki or other programs.
*   You may upload words and expressions into LWT (from LingQ or other sources, CSV/TSV) - they are immediately available in all texts!
*   **New since Version 1.5.0:** Create and edit an improved annotated text version (a [hyperliteral translation](http://learnanylanguage.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperliteral_translations) as [interlinear text](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlinear_gloss)) for online or offline learning.
